                    <h2>Beth Halel Trame</h2>
                    <h3>Google</h3>
                    <p>Beth Trame spent the last 6 years working in startups in the Bay Area, but started it all with a soldering gun and hypodermic needles filled with glue. Making Square credit card readers by hand, gosh where's your head at?? The next obvious step in her startup career was to start building customer service teams and making mistakes like it's her job. Thankfully, being a self-aware enough human, mistakes make for great stories and even better learning examples for why data analysis and focusing on the customer experience through the agent is the right move. From Square, to Getaround, to Cherry, to Lyft, to Google Fiber, Beth brings the new-fangled concept of UX to customer service. </p>
