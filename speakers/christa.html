                    <p>For the last eight years, I've served as the Vice President of Customer Care at Squarespace. I was the first member of the Customer Care department, so I had to build the department from the ground up, creating and implementing all of our practices and policies and hiring, then training the whole department. I oversaw the department's expansion to 200 associates in three international locations (New York, Dublin, and Portland).</p>
                    <p>Customer service is my passion and I’ve dedicated my professional career to creating processes, scaling teams, and most importantly connecting people and putting them on a path that makes their work as rewarding as mine.</p>
