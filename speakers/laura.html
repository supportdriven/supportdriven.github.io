                    <h3>Livestream</h3>

                    <p>
                        Laura Marciano is the Head of Customer Operations at Livestream, where she has worked since
                        2010.
                        She is responsible for designing and implementing a delightful service and support experience
                        for Livestream customers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to scaling the Livestream Customer Care team, Laura has helped grow a culture of
                        customer empathy and is constantly implementing new processes and ideas to improve customer
                        success.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A Buffalo, New York native, Laura relocated to New York City in 2006. She holds a degree from
                        the State University of New York at Fredonia in Communications.

                    <p>
                        When she isn’t glued to her computer, Laura can be found at the park with her two dogs, sampling
                        new restaurant menus in the 5 boroughs, and trying very hard not to binge watch reality TV.
