                    <h2>Mireille Pilloud</h2>
                    <h3>TED</h3>
                    <p>Mireille manages the support team at TED. Her work at Apple retail and an IT support company (among other random jobs: an armored truck company and video rental store - when that was still a thing) helped prepare her for a life of helping people with technology. She enjoys long walks in the mountains and a good sunset.</p>
