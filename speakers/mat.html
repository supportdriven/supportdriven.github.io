                        Mat Patterson ran a small tech support team way back in the 90s, a role from which he was fairly quickly removed. He then spent years as a web designer for companies including ASX and Booking.com before starting and building the customer service team at Campaign Monitor.

                        In 2016, after 9 years with Campaign Monitor, Mat joined Help Scout where he preaches the good word on customer service to anyone who will listen.
