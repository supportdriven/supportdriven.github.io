                    <h2>Sonya Green</h2>
                    <p>Sonya is best known for her work at GitHub, building the customer support team and holding the title Chief Empathy Officer. She enjoys helpful error messages and stellar documentation. She nerds out on books like "How to Win Friends and Influence People", which is not as creepy as it sounds. She cut her teeth on customer support with a booklover social network, back in the aughts. She’s currently moonlighting as a support consultant for startups and in the process of moving to Boston.</p>
                    <p>Before joining techland, Sonya was a children's librarian, wildland firefighter, bike mechanic, signmaker, and pharmaceutical proofreader. You’ll never guess which one had the most conflagration.</p>
