                    <p>Chris "fool" is listed on his personal card as a Joy Facilitator, Adventurer, and Community Builder.  By day he has embraced a Support Driven lifestyle and helped grow New Relic's support team from 3 to 60 for the last 4 years. These days he is Jama Software's first Support Operations Lead.  He loves SaaS, medium sized data (big data can be too much to swallow!), and finding silver linings and sharing them with friends and customers.</p>
